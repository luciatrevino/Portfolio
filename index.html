      <p>From an early age, my fascination with technology and aerospace has been the driving force behind my academic pursuits.<br> 
      As I embark on my college journey, I am committed to obtaining degrees in both Computer Engineering and Aerospace Engineering. 
      This dual focus will enable me to harness the synergies of these fields and contribute meaningfully to advancements in technology and space exploration.<br> 
      I have chosen this field to realize my creative potential fully.<br>
      In an era of unprecedented technological evolution, I recognize that engineers are pivotal in sculpting our societal landscape.<br>
      My ambition is to contribute to this technological progression.</p>

  <p class="middleSen">
    I was granted permission to work as an intern at Innovation Point's Nextech Catapult in May<br>
    2024. I was able to learn how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript throughout the duration of<br>
    the program. All in all, I focused on honing my soft skills, which included collaboration, critical <br>
    thinking, problem-solving, communication, and teamwork. I was able to strengthen these <br>
    abilities through the training and so enhance my work ethic. I'm also planning on majoring in<br>
    computer engineering with a computer science minor at The University of Evansville.<br>
    <b>below are the percentages of how comfortable I am using those skills.</b>
